#### proof-remove
A script that filters all sections of the form `\begin{proof} ... \end{proof}` out of a LaTeX file.

**[UPDATE]** Seems like there already exist some LaTeX-packages that contain this functionality...

1. The [`comment`](https://ctan.org/pkg/comment)-package (via the command `excludecomment`)
2. The [versions](https://ctan.org/pkg/versions)-package (via the command `excludeversion`)
