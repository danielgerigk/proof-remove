# proof-remove
A script that filters all sections of the form "\begin{proof} ... \end{proof}" out of a LaTeX file.

[UPDATE] Seems like there are already some LaTeX-packages that contain this functionality:

	1) The `comment`-package (https://ctan.org/pkg/comment) with the command `excludecomment`

	2) The `versions`-package (https://ctan.org/pkg/versions) with the command `excludeversion`
