#### proof-remove
A script that filters out of a LaTeX file all sections of the form `\begin{proof} ... \end{proof}`.

**[UPDATE]** There already exist several LaTeX-packages that have the same functionality...

1. The [comment](https://ctan.org/pkg/comment)-package (via `excludecomment`)
2. The [versions](https://ctan.org/pkg/versions)-package (via `excludeversion`)
